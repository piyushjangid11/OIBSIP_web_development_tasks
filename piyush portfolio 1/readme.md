- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to display my projects with images and descriptions.
- **Contact Information**: Easy access to my email, phone, and LinkedIn profile.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For interactive features and dynamic content.

## How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Piyush-Jangid/your-portfolio.git](https://github.com/Piyush-Jangid/your-portfolio.git)
    ```
    *(Replace `your-portfolio` with the actual repository name once you create it.)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd your-portfolio
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`**:
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. There is no need for a local server as the project consists of static files.

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
-   `style.css`: All the CSS styles for the design.
